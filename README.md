# N1 Wunderlist

Extremely simple plugin for Nylas N1 email client to interact with Wunderlist.

## Installation

1. Download and run N1.

2. Download (or clone) this repo.

3. From the menu, select `Developer > Install a Package Manually...` and choose the directory where you downloaded this repo.


## Usage

When you have an email open, you can use a new button in the toolbar to convert that email into a Wunderlist task.  
The plugin basically forwards the email to the address `me@wunderlist.com`, which will create a new task in your Wunderlist `Inbox`.  

For this to work, you need to have a Wunderlist account registered with the email address that is the recipient of the email you are trying to send to Wunderlist!
