# N1 Wunderlist

Extremely simple plugin for Nylas N1 email client to interact with Wunderlist.

## Installation

1. Download and run N1.

2. Download (or clone) this repo.

3. From the menu, select `Developer > Install a Package Manually...` and choose the directory where you downloaded this repo.


## Usage

- Open an email and click the 'Add to Wunderlist' button on the toolbar.

- Go to your Wunderlist account and you will see the email as a new task in your Inbox!


## How it works

This plugin basically forwards the open email to `me@wunderlist.com`, which will create a new task in your Wunderlist `Inbox` list.

For this to work, you need a Wunderlist account for the email address that is the recipient of the email you are sending.
